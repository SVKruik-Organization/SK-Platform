# SK Platform - frontend

This directory is home to the now deprecated Vue Options API frontend. It has been replaced by a Nuxt Composition API frontend. This has been done for better SEO performance. Once the new Nuxt version is stable and battle-tested, I will replace this directory with the Nuxt version. CI/CD deployment of the Nuxt version has been completed already, so now it's just testing.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://url.skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
