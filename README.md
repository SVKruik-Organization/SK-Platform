Welcome to SK Platform, the place where the whole project comes together. SK Platform is the homepage of this project. It features SK Docs, account management and a lot more. If you want to start using my products, this is the place to be. Check out the website [here](https://platform.stefankruik.com), and [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support) if you have any questions.

SK Horizon is also located here, but that is just a simple static sitemap to let users know what apps and domains exist.

---

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
