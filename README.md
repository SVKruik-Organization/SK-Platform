Welcome to SK Platform, the place where the whole project comes together. SK Platform is the homepage of this project. It features SK Docs, account management and a lot more. If you want to start using my products, this is the place to be. Check out the website [here](https://platform.stefankruik.com), and [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support) if you have any questions.

This repository contains the following products:

- [SK Platform](https://platform.stefankruik.com/), the place where SK Platform and its sub-products come together.
- [SK Horizon](https://www.stefankruik.com/), the global landing website for all my projects. Serves as a human-readable sitemap.
- [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation), expansive information hub to deep-dive into SK Platform.

Because a simple `README.md` can only do so much, I have also made an documentation platform, [SK Docs](https://platform.stefankruik.com/documentation). If you are serious about using my products, I highly recommend reading the relevant articles. Don't have time for that? Don't hesitate to [reach out](https://skpvt.io/r/support). I am always open to have a chat and answer questions to your heart's content, unless I am debugging deployment ðŸ˜„.
